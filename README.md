Nodebot Workshop [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/tableflip/nodebot-workshop.svg)](https://david-dm.org/tableflip/nodebot-workshop)
================

**A [nodeschool][1] workshop on how to get your Arduino alive with [rwaldron/johnny-five][2]**

![Nodebot workshop menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tableflip/nodebot-workshop/master/screenshot.png)

Learn the basics of the [johnny-five][2] api, as a series of code challenges.

[johnny-five][2] is an api for working with Arduino and other rapid prototyping boards.

**You _don't_ need an Arduino for this workshop.**

The workshop will pose a challenge, and will test your code.

The low level code to talk to the Arduino is stubbed out.

**You _will_ be writing working, executable johnny-five code.**

Each of your solutions can be run directly as a `node` program.

Wire up an Arduino, connect the USB and you can see you solution run for real.
